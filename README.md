# React + TypeScript + Vite

To run the App locally:-
 1. Clone the repo.
 2. run -> npm install
 3. run->  npm run dev

## I have done better

1. I have done a good job in card display.
2. Search functionality is also I have done well.
3. Rest are small but Infinite scroll I have also done which was new to me.


## I can do better

I have created this app using Vite and I choose this over create-react-app to build the app faster.
There are lots of things I can do like styling . I have done decent styling according to the given time.
I can add testing also for better coverage.
